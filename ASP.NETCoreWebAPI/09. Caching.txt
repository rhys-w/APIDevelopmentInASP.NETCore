Caching:

Get
- Request: Get, Version=lat_xyz, Hello World
- Response: 304 Not Modified
- Lets the client ask the server if it has the latest version without getting and sending back.

Put
- For concurrency (letting multiple people use the system at once)
- Request: Put, If-Match=last_xyz, Hell World
- Checks if the last_xyz data is the same as what is on the server
- Make the change if it is
- If it isn't, someone else must have changed it since
- Response: 412 Precondition failed

Entity Tags (ETags)
- Strong and Weak Caching Support
- Strong - when things are not likely to change (in weeks)
- Weak - short lived, likely to change regularly

ETag Examples
- Weak: W/"12345"
- Strong: "12345"
