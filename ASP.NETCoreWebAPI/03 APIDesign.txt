API DESIGN:

Api Design
- Nouns are Good, Verbs are Bad
- Prefer Nouns e.g. customers, invoivces, products, employees
- Nouns contain resources 
- Prefer plurals e.g. customers not customer.

Resources (What are they?):
- People, Invoices, Products
- Nouns you want to expose through the API
- A resource can be a complex object within a given context
	(Not necessarily just one entity)

Identifiers in URI's
- Use unique identifiers
- Does not have to be 'primary keys'

Query Strings
- Use for non-resource properties
	e.g. sorts, pages, formats


Verbs and URI's

How do I do Verbs then?

Resource: Customers

/customers
Get: Get List
Post: New Customer
Put: Update Batch (rare)
Delete: Error

/customers/123
Get: Get Item
Post: Error
Put: Update Item
Delete: Delete Item
