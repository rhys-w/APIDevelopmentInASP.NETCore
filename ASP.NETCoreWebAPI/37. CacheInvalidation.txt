Cache Invalidation:

A lot is automated:
	- Responses go stale
	- ETags get updated

Not always sufficient:
	- Resource manipulation can have an effect on other resources
		- Updating a course (on its own) affects the resources resource
		- If you updated a course in a cached courses resource, it is out of date.

CDNs allow for cache invalidation via easy to configure rules and easy to use SDKs
