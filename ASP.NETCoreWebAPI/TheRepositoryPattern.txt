The Repository Pattern.

An abstraction that...
	- Reduces complexity
	- Aims to make the code safe for the repository implementation
	- Persistence ignorant

Advantages of the Repository Pattern
	- Less code duplication
	- Less error-prone
	- Better testability of the consuming class

Persistence Ignorant
	- Switching out the persistence technology is not the main purpose.
	- Choosing the best one for each repository method is.

The repository pattern
	- We're working on a contract, not implementation
		- Allows a mock repo in testing
	- Always have the methods matching req. functionality and call them
		- even if they don't do anything currently
		- futureproofs the code
