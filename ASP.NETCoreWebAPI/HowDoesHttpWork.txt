How Does HTTP Work?

Request sent, containing:
- verb, the action to take 	e.g. POST
- headers, information about the request
- content, optionally asked for

Example:
VERB		POST
HEADERS		Content Length: 11
CONTENT		Hello World

Get a response back, containing:
- status code
- headers
- content

Example:
STATUS CODE	201
HEADERS		Content Type: text
CONTENT 	Hello World
