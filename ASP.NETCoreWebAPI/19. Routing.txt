Routing

	Routing matches a request URI to an action on a controller.

app.UseRouting()

	- Marks the position in the middleware pipeline where a 
		routing decision is made.

app.UseEndpoints()

	- Marks the position in the middleware pipeline where the selected 
		endpoint is executed.

Example of Middleware

	Authentication:
		app.UseRouting();
		app.UseAuthorization();
		app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => { // map endpoints });

Mapping Endpoints - How?

	1. Convention based routing:
		
		Endpoints are added to actions on a controller following a convention.

		app.UseRouting();
		app.UseAuthorization();
		app.UseEndpoint(endpoints => {
			endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
				name: "default",
				pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
			endpoints.MapRazorPages();
		});

	2. Attribute-based Routing
		
		No conventions are applied.
		They are setup through attributes instead.
		Attributes are added at controller and action level: [Route], [HttpGet], ...

		app.UseRouting();
		app.UseAuthorization();
		app.UseEndpoints(endpoints => {
			endpoints.MapControllers();
		});
