Caching Summary:

Each response must state whether or not it can be cached

Cache Types:
	- Private or shared
	- Depending on the type, a model can reduce bandwidth requirements and/or
		network roundtrips

Caching: Expiration Model
	- Allows the server to state how long a response is considered fresh
	- Uses the Cache-Control header

Caching: Validation Model
	- Used to valdiate the freshness of a response that's been cached
	- Strong Validators - ETags
	- Weak Validators - Last Modified headers, weak ETags
		
Implementation:
	- Control the Cache-Control header with the ResponseCache attribute
	- Store responses with the ResponseCaching middleware
