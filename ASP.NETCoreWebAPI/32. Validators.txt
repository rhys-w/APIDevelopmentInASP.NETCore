Validators:

Validation Model
	
	Used to validate the 'freshness' of a response that's been cached
	
Strong Validators

	Change if the body or headers of a response change

	ETag (Entity Tag) response header
		ETag: "123456789"

	Can be used in any context (equality is guaranteed)

Weak validators

	Don't always change when the response changes (e.g. only on significant changes)

	Last-Modified: Sat, 21 Sep 2019 15:23:40 GMT
		(weak) (clocks must be synchronised)

	ETag: "w/123456789" 
		(weak ETag) (server decides when this changes)

	Equivalence, but not equality

Validation Model and Cache Types
	
	Private cache
		- Reduces bandwidth requirements

	Shared (public) cache
		- Saves bandwidth between cache and API
