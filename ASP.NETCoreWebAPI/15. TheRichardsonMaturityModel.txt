The Richardson Maturity Model:

Level 0 - The Swamp of POX

	Plan Old XML.
	Http is used for remote interaction.
	The rest of the protocol isn't used as it should be.
	Using Http but only as a transfer protocol.
	RPC-style implementation.
	
	e.g. one api you can POST to (/host/api)

Level 1 - Resources

	Each resource is mapped to a URI.
	Multiple URI's.

	e.g.	1. POST 	/api/authors
			2. POST 	/api/authors/{id}

Level 2 - Verbs

	Correct Http verbs are used.
	Correct status codes are used.
	Removes unnecessary variation.

	e.g.	1. GET		/api/authors	returns 200 Ok (authors)
			2. GET		/api/authors	returns 201 Created (author)
	
Level 3 - Hypermedia

	The API supports Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS).
	HATEOAS is the most commonly skipped REST constraint.
	When skipped, an API isn't actually REST.
	Introduces discoverability.

	e.g.	1. GET		/api/authors	returns 200 Ok (authors 
										+ links that drive application state)
