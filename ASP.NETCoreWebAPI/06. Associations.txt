Associations:

- Sub objects for existing API's
	- e.g. invoices for a customer 
		/api/customers/123/invoices
	- e.g. ratings for a specific game 
		/api/games/halo-3/ratings
	- e.g. payments related to a specific invoice
		/api/invoices/2003-01-24/payments

- Should return lists with the same shape, in different scopes
	/api/customers/123/invoices
	/api/invoices
	These both return a list of the same shape, just with different scopes

- Endpoints can have multiple associations
	/api/customers/123/invoices
	/api/customers/123/payments
	/api/customers/123/shipments

- Search should use queries

- Don't use associations to get things like...
	- 'all customers in a state'
		/api/customers?st=GA
	- 'all customers with sales id in state'
		/api/customers?st=GA&salesid=144
