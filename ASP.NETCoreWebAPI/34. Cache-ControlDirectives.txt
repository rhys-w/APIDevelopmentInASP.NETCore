Cache-Control Directives:

Response:
	
	Freshness:			
		max-age				- max-age before expiring (s)
		
		s-maxage			- overrides max-age for shared
							- for different expiry in private and shared cache

	Cache type:
		public				- can be cached anywhere
		
		private				- intended for single user, not for shared cache

	Validation:
		no-cache			- don't use in subsequent requests without revalidating 

		must-revalidate		- if response is stale, revalidate (force revalidation)

		proxy-revalidate	- same as above but doesn't apply to private user caches

	Other:
		no-store			- cache must not store

		no-transform		- cache doesn't transform media type of response body

Request:
	Freshness:
		max-age				- max age client will accept

		min-fresh			- minimum accepted val of current age + time in seconds 
							- a response that will still be fresh in x seconds

		max-stale			- client will accept response that has exceeded expiration
							- must-revalidate uses this

	Validation:
		no-cache			- response shouldn't be used again without successful
								revalidation with origin server

	Other:
		no-store			- same as response

		no-transform		- same as response

		only-if-cached		- client wants cache to return responses that are stored,
								nothing from the origin server
							- typically served when there is a poor connection
