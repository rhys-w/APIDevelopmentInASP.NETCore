Cache Stores & Content Delivery Networks:

Ensure your API can return Cache-Control headers and supports 
expiration/validation models

Combine that with a cache server of CDN.

Cache Stores

	Most cache stores are full-blown cache servers, not pieces of middleware
		- They often require deep knowledge of how to configure them.
	
	Private Caches
		- Live on the client
			- Xamarin app,s WPF apps,
		- Example:	CacheCow.Client			https://github.com/aliostad/CacheCow
	
	Shared Caches
		- Gateway or proxy caches
		- Full-blown cache servers
		- Examples:	Varnish					https://varnish-cache.org./
					Apache Traffic Server	http://trafficserver.apache.org/
					Squid					http://www.squid-cache.org/

	Advantages:
		- Open open source
		- Often free to use
		- Often supports invalidation mechanism (but not always, and can be harder to
			setup than with a CDN)

Alternative: Content Delivery Network

	What it is:
		A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network)
		that deliver pages and other web content to a suer, based on the geographic 
		locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and the content delivery server.
	
	Most of the Internet runs on various CDN's
		- Ensuring the fast loading speed of popular websites
	
	CDNs extensively use caching: HTTP cache
		- No need to set up a cache server ourselves
		- Provided out of the box and simply configured
	
	Popular CDN examples:
		Azure CDN				https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cdn/
		Cloudflare				https://www.cloudflare.com
		Akamai					https://www.akarmai.com

	Advantages:
		CDNs allow for cache invalidation via easy to configure rules and easy to use SDKs

	Disadvantages:
		Cost. If you're expecting to cache a lot of responses, expect to pay for it.
