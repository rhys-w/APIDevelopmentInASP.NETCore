Deferred Execution

The query variable never holds the query results. 
It only stores the query commands.

Execution of the query is deferred until the query is iterated over.

Query execution occurs sometime after query is constructed.

To cause execution, use...
- foreach loop
- ToList(), ToArray(), ToDictionary()
- Singleton queries (average, count, first)
