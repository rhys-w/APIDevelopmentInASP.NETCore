Formatters and Content Negotiation

	Media type is passed via the Accept header of the request.
	e.g.	application/json	return json
			application/xml		reutrn xml
			...					possibly a default format.

	When returning a representation in a default format when the requested
	media type isn't available isn't acceptable.
		- return 406 - Not Acceptable.
		- this is a client decision.
